To add your title, your page structure etc. just copy your desired templates 
files from the simpleframework/templates folder to your own templates folder
that you can find in this application; you don't need to copy and edit every 
single file you find in the templates folder, just the ones you want to modify,
the others will be picked up automatically from the framework templates folder.

If you need to access databases, copy the settings.ini.php file inside your 
application and add the desired credentials.

Open you index.php file and add your content; if you need sessions for 
authentication a simple logout page is provided.
